**Lab 2- Train a custom GAN model**

As part of this lab, you will learn to build a custom GAN architecture and train the model. Follow the steps below:

Navigate to Amazon SageMaker using the link: https://console.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/home?region=us-east-1#/dashboard

![notebook-instance](images/notebook-instance.PNG)

Click **Notebook instances** from the left navigation bar

![open-instance](images/open-instance.PNG)

Click **Open Jupyter**

![open-notebook](images/open-notebook.PNG)

Click **DeepComposerWorkshop** folder

![GAN-notebook](images/GAN-notebook.PNG)

Click **GAN.ipynb**

![kernel-error](images/kernel-error.PNG)

*If you come across the above error, choose the drop down and select **conda_python3** as the kernel*

![set-kernel](images/set-kernel.PNG)

Select **conda_python3** as the kernel and click **set kernel**

This notebook contains instructions and code to create a custom GAN model from scratch. Scroll through the notebook content.

![run-notebook](images/run-notebook.PNG)

To run the code cells, choose the code cell you want to run and click **Run**

![kernel-empty](images/kernel-empty.png)

If the kernel has an empty circle, it means it is free and ready to execute the code 

![kernel-busy](images/kernel-busy.png)

If the kernel has a filled circle, it means it is busy. Wait for it to become free before you execute the next line of code.

**Congratulations on building a custom GAN model from scratch!**
